# Crowdfunding_ETL

This repository is for ETL project 2, in here you will find the main jupyter notebook with all the of extract and transform happening. In the resources folder I have uploaded the png of the ERD created from the csv files produced from the extract transform process.  You will also find the sql for creating the schemas in postgres as well as images that show the tables and the data loaded properly into the tables.
